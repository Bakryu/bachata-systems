# HaloAgency - Modern Web Development Agency Website

A comprehensive, multi-page agency website built with Next.js, inspired by halo-lab.com design principles. Features modern animations, 3D elements, and a clean, professional aesthetic.

## 🚀 Features

### Core Technologies
- **Next.js 15** with App Router and TypeScript
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with custom design system
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and micro-interactions
- **React Three Fiber** for 3D hero scenes and interactive elements
- **React Intersection Observer** for scroll-triggered animations

### Design System
- **Halo-Lab Inspired Palette**: Clean white backgrounds with charcoal text, deep blue accents, and bright yellow highlights
- **Typography**: Inter font family for modern, readable text
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with seamless desktop scaling
- **Accessibility**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and includes proper ARIA labels

### Key Components

#### 🎨 AnimatedCTA Component
Reusable call-to-action button with text scroll animation:
- Text slides up and fades out on hover
- Identical text enters from bottom
- Supports multiple variants (primary, secondary, outline)
- Configurable sizes (sm, md, lg)

```tsx
<AnimatedCTA href="/contact" variant="primary" size="lg">
  Get Started Today
</AnimatedCTA>
```

#### 📱 Scroll Reveal Animations
Smooth scroll-triggered animations throughout the site:
- Staggered fade and translate effects
- Configurable direction, delay, and duration
